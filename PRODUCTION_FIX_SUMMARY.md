# Production Database Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The `/fees` page and other essential pages were returning 404 errors in production, even though they worked correctly in development.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Development vs Production Database Discrepancy
- **Development Database**: Had 8 pages including all essential pages (fees, bylaws, contact, recycling, organics, renovations, gallery, marketplace)
- **Production Database**: Only had 1 page titled "No Pay|IMPORTANT NOTICE"

### Investigation Findings
1. The API endpoint `/api/pages/fees` was working correctly on the backend
2. The frontend routing was properly configured with the `/fees` route pointing to `DynamicPage` component
3. The `DynamicPage` component was correctly making API calls to fetch page data
4. The server logs showed 404 responses for the fees page lookup in production
5. Direct database queries revealed the production database was missing essential pages

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix
1. Created a comprehensive seed script with all essential pages
2. Executed the seed script in the production container
3. Verified that all pages were successfully created and accessible

### Long-term Prevention
1. **Updated Main Seed Script**: Enhanced `scripts/seed.js` to include all essential pages:
   - fees (Strata Fees & Payments)
   - bylaws (Building Bylaws)  
   - contact (Contact Information)
   - recycling (Recycling & Waste)
   - organics (Organics Program)
   - renovations (Renovations & Alterations)
   - gallery (Photo Gallery)
   - marketplace (Strata Marketplace)

2. **Deployment Process**: The Dockerfile already includes automatic seeding:
   ```dockerfile
   CMD ["sh", "-c", "npx prisma db push && npm run db:seed && npm start"]
   ```
   This ensures that every container deployment will:
   - Apply database migrations
   - Run the seed script (creating missing pages)
   - Start the application server

## Database Seeding Strategy

The seed script is designed to be **idempotent**:
- If a page already exists, it updates the content
- If a page doesn't exist, it creates it
- This ensures the seed script can be run multiple times safely

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check Development Database**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   node -e "const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client'); const prisma = new PrismaClient(); prisma.page.findMany().then(pages => console.log('Pages:', pages.map(p => p.slug)))"
   ```

2. **Check Production Container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_id> sqlite3 data/database.db "SELECT slug, title FROM pages;"
   ```

3. **Test API Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3331/api/pages/fees
   curl http://localhost:3331/api/pages/bylaws
   # etc.
   ```

## Key Learnings

1. **Database State Synchronization**: Production and development databases can get out of sync if seeding isn't part of the deployment process
2. **Comprehensive Seeding**: Essential application data should always be included in seed scripts
3. **Container Persistence**: Database state in containers needs to be properly managed through seeding

## Files Modified

- `scripts/seed.js` - Enhanced to include all essential pages
- Temporary files created and cleaned up during troubleshooting

## Prevention for Future Deployments

The enhanced seed script in combination with the existing Dockerfile configuration ensures that:
1. Every new deployment will have all essential pages
2. Existing deployments will get updated page content
3. The application will function correctly regardless of initial database state

## Testing

After implementing this fix:
- ✅ `/fees` page loads correctly
- ✅ All other essential pages are accessible
- ✅ Development and production databases have consistent page data
- ✅ Future deployments will automatically include all pages
